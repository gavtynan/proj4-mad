A couple notes, everything is named Project 5 cause I just finished Project 5 for another class and it was stuck in my head and I honestly did not care to change it. Second, nothing in my app was saved to the tomcat web apps folder, probably because of the way I configured it, so truthfully I don't even know if this is going to run if you try. Last, AND MOST IMPORTANT, because of how I setup my artificat, all pages are proceeded with /Project5/ so if you manage to get it running it'll just put up on localhost:8080 which is just going to 404 for you. To start the app you just gotta put in /project5/login and everything will work from there.
